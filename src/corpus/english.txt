nobel peace prize the nobel committee said it was in honour of the opcw s extensive work to eliminate chemical weapons the opcw based in the hague was established to enforce the chemical weapons convention opcw director general ahmet uzumcu said the award was a great honour and would spur it on in its work he said the deployment of chemical weapons in syria had been a tragic reminder that there remains much work to be done the opcw recently sent inspectors to oversee the dismantling of syria s stockpile of chemical weapons it is the first time opcw inspectors have worked in an active war zone the watchdog picks up a gold medal and m swedish kronor m as winner of the most coveted of the nobel honours vindication announcing the award in oslo norwegian nobel committee chairman thorbjoern jagland said it wanted to recognise the opcw s extensive work whilst clearly we predicted and prepared for substantial activity in royal mail shares the volumes involved have gone off any conventional scale we have processed many thousands of trades on behalf of our clients and continue to do so but some clients will have had difficulty getting through on the telephone and experienced intermittent website issues we have six times the normal number of dealing staff working today and continue to work hard to deal with the demand we will keep working flat out until our normal fluent service is restored we d like to apologise to our clients for any issues they have experienced this morning and as we enter this weekend i am as pleased as punch for the company and in particular for gert zonneveld joint head of research for having the effrontery to flag up royal mail as an investor snip how right he was to have the courage of his convictions he was spot on the money perhaps he was fortunate being an independent analyst which allowed him to express his views without qualification gert stood up and he was counted the ones who missed out throughout the morning we ve been hearing from disappointed readers who bid for or more and have been completely excluded from the share offering the government decided yesterday that those wealthy enough to bid such a high sum would be least bothered about missing out on a small allocation of shares mike wood tells us he applied for of shares split equally between him and his wife in the full expectation that the issue could be scaled down by anything up to two thirds jack straw said that the paper had shown an almost adolescent excitement about having the material and suggested that the secrets had gone to their head his intervention represents the first time a former labour minister has intervened in the row and comes after the head of mi warned that the leaks were a gift to terrorists mr straw told bbc news i m not suggesting for a moment anybody in the guardian gratuitously wants to risk anybody s life but what i do think is that their sense of power of having these secrets and excitement almost adolescent excitement about these secrets has gone to their head they re blinding themselves about the consequence and also showing an extraordinary naivete and arrogance in implying that they are in a position to judge whether or not particular secrets are not likely to damage the national interest they re not in any position at all to do that the issue has divided the liberal democrats nick clegg the deputy prime minister said yesterday that the leaks would be of immense interest to people who want to do us harm mr clegg said that while he accepted that there was a legitimate debate to be had about the data gathering practices of the security services the guardian had gone too far he told his call clegg phone in show on lbc radio i ve got no doubt that there were some parts of what were published which would have passed most guardian readers completely by because they were very technical but would have been immensely interesting for people who want to do us harm a downing street spokesman yesterday denied claims that the government is conducting a review into the parliamentary oversight of the intelligence services the spokesman said that the prime minister is content with the current system of oversight but added that the deputy prime minister can pursue any concerns through the national security council theresa may the home secretary said she agreed with mr parker that the guardian had damaged britain s national security by publishing the information she told bbc news i agree with andrew parker i think it is difficult when you have revelations about how security operates then that does cause a problem it can give some comfort to terrorists and he was very clear about the statement that he made and i think we need to be very clear about the need to ensure that we have the security arrangements in place that enable us to continue to protect the british public the telegraph has disclosed that britain s deputy national security advisor has warned that the mass gchq leaks have already caused real damage to security oliver robbins said the edward snowden revelations published by the guardian newspaper could lead directly to widespread loss of life and threaten the internal stability of the uk a senior mp also accused the newspaper and snowden of being naive if they thought they could identify what parts of the stolen files would damage national security if publicised he said revealing intelligence techniques had given fanatics the advantage that allowed them to evade detection david cameron the prime minister backed the comments but despite the warnings the editor of the guardian alan rusbridger vowed to continue publishing details from the snowden files he dismissed the concerns of the spy agencies adding they will always say that mr robbins who is based in the cabinet office detailed the government s concerns in a statement to the high court as part of an ongoing legal battle following the detention of david miranda at heathrow airport mr miranda is the boyfriend of glenn greenwald the guardian journalist who made a series of disclosures based on information from snowden a former cia analyst he was found with electronic devices containing up to sensitive documents which were seized by police mr miranda was later allowed to continue his journey to brazil in his court statement mr robbins said the material was classified as either secret or top secret he said the compromise of top secret information would be likely to have one or more of the following consequences to threaten the internal stability of the uk or friendly countries to lead directly to widespread loss of life to cause exceptionally grave damage to the effectiveness or security of uk or allied forces or to the continuing effectiveness of security or intelligence operations to cause exceptionally grave damage to relations with friendly governments and to cause severe long term damage to the uk economy mr robbins added it is worth reiterating the point that real damage has in fact already been done to uk national security by the media revelations both in the uk and internationally the government adviser said the leaks had put the lives of uk intelligence agents at risk and signalled some have already had to be moved he said it appeared a complete set of the uk intelligence documents on one particular network had been taken by snowden there are fears that foreign states such as russia or china may have already had access to the files after snowden sheltered there sir malcolm rifkind chairman of the parliamentary body which oversees the spy agencies said leaks had been damaging he said the intelligence agencies should be trusted to operate in secret because they are not political tools of repression like security services in russia and china sir malcolm chairman of the intelligence and security committee told the telegraph when we know that snowden has over classified documents relevant to uk interests the idea that he or others would be able identify which are damaging to national security is naive even knowing the technology that is available to gchq or mi or mi is valuable some of these terrorists are very very smart it s not like the old days when communication could only be by letter or telephone call unless they the security services are at the cutting edge of modern technology they will be behind the terrorists who are smart on encryption and trying to conceal what they are doing asked whether mr cameron agreed with mr parker that the leaks had been a gift to potential terrorists the no spokesman said i would happily point you to all parts of the director general s speech it was an excellent speech however mr rusbridger defended his newspaper s role in publishing the sensitive information claiming it was stepping in where mps had failed he told bbc radio s world at one it s quite surprising to me that the number of mps in this country who have said anything at all in the last four months can be counted on one hand malcolm rifkind tom watson david davis so if parliament s not going to have this discussion and if the courts can only do this in private then i think absolutely it falls to the press to stimulate a discussion which as i say through america throughout europe is one that the public is intensely interested in challenged on mr parker s suggestions that publishing the information was helping terrorists he replied they will always say that you read histories of intelligence and you go back to the s and the security people were saying the same and he added we are working slowly and responsibly through the files but as we discover further stories that we think merit the debate the debate that everyone says is necessary then we will go on publishing a researcher from the organisation interviewed survivors of an offensive against villages occupied by members of the alawite sect to which the assad family belongs in latakia province confirming widespread reports of atrocities the attack followed regime massacres of hundreds of civilians in two sunni towns in the same province in may and was described by the militants own propaganda outlets in highly vengeful sectarian terms alawite villagers told how they returned to their homes to find relatives often those too old or infirm to flee butchered my dad stayed in the house said one man who fled with his mother he was killed in his bed my aunt she is an year old blind woman was also killed in her room in another graphic account hassan shebli who lived in the village of barouda showed hrw the house where his wife shamieh ali darwish and son safwan shebli were killed both were disabled you can still see the blood he said hrw found videos posted online by the militants with mrs darwish and safwan shebli at home mrs darwish is seen walking on crutches but when mr shebli returned he found their graves behind the house three other members of the extended shebli family were killed altogether the researcher compiled a list of names of civilians who had been killed in the attacks which began on august she had evidence that had been executed or otherwise killed illegally the evidence in other cases was not clear the evidence gathered by human rights watch strongly suggests that the killings hostage taking and other abuses committed by the opposition forces on august rise to the level of crimes against humanity the report concludes the scale and organization of these crimes indicate that they were systematic as well as being planned as part of an attack on a civilian population about civilians were taken as hostages by the rebels the report added negotiations are continuing for their release it said the attacks had a clear sectarian agenda with a local alawite shrine desecrated and the sheikh who was the presiding religious authority executed for supporting mr assad early in may alawite led militias killed over and as many as people in two districts of the town of baniyas on latakia s coast rebel militias swore revenge at the time the hrw researcher was escorted to the villages by regime officials and soldiers who now control the area again on the first trip inside the country licensed by the government however its report points out that it has previously accused the regime of war crimes and crimes against humanity and that accusations against one side do not vindicate the other in a finding that has international ramifications it says funding for the attack on the alawite villages was raised privately in the gulf including wealthy donors in kuwait it was led by mainly jihadist groups including the islamic state of iraq and the levant isil jabhat al nusra and the foreign legion of jaish al muhajireen wal ansar all of which are affiliated to al qaeda and two other militant islamist groups ahrar al sham suqour al ezz the researcher lama fakih said it was not clear whether rebels of the western backed free syrian army participated in the killings and the political opposition in exile the syrian national coalition said in a statement that what happened did not represent an effort by the true syrian opposition but rather a shameful one time attack by outlier extremist groups that thrive under the hand of the assad regime hrw urged gulf states and the authorities in turkey through which most of the foreign support for the militant islamists passes to do more to cut off supply lines to them a court in murmansk ruled that philip ball of oxfordshire and kieron bryan from london should remain in pre trial detention until november the pair were among six britons on board the organisation s boat arctic sunrise held on september greenpeace has called from the release of mr bryan on the basis he was a journalist working alongside activists all people on the vessel have been accused of piracy which carries a maximum sentence of years four earlier bail applications from russians including another journalist were also refused freelance video journalist mr bryan appeared in court behind a glass screen wearing a green checked shirt russia s interfax news agency quoted him as saying he did not have journalistic accreditation and intended to sell his footage after returning from the arctic harsh punishment i had just verbal contracts verbal agreements with many leading tv companies that i would provide them with footage afterwards bryan told the court greenpeace uk executive director john sauven said the court s decision flies in the face of all reasonhe added the decision of the court to refuse bail looks increasingly like the russian authorities are meting out unnecessarily harsh punishment even before any trial in the case of kieron bryan he is a professional journalist travelling on the greenpeace ship witnessing a peaceful protest against oil drilling in the arctic ocean he has committed no crime and should be released immediately the bbc s moscow correspondent daniel sandford reports that lawyers for the two men argued that the gazprom s prirazlomnaya oil platform is more like an island than a ship so piracy charges should not apply sergey golubuk a lawyer for greenpeace international said the detainees were denying the charge of piracy defined by international law as violent attack with personal gain in mind at sea he told bbc radio s today programme all these basic indefensible elements of piracy are obviously lacking in all people on board arctic sunrise without exception mr bryan s brother said his family had not been able to speak to him since his arrest and were finding the situation difficult the year old originally from shebbear in north devon has only been able to contact his family through a single letter written nearly two weeks ago poppy straw russell bryan told today mum and dad are finding it very hard and myself as well we haven t heard from kieron in almost three weeks now in terms of phone calls it s been very hard not being able to speak to him kieron is a freelance journalist he is not a greenpeace member or a greenpeace activist this is not something that kieron would have anticipated at all russia s investigative committee has said the charges against some of those detained might change because drugs thought to be poppy straw and morphine were found on the boat poppy straw or raw opium can be used to produce morphine or heroin the committee also said investigators were trying to establish which detainees were responsible for deliberately ramming russian coastguard boats in the arctic greenpeace said any suggestion illegal drugs were found was a smear and fabrication as its ships only carry medical supplies required under maritime law the uk government meanwhile has raised the case of the six detained britons with the russian authorities those being held with activist mr ball and mr bryan are logistics co ordinator frank hewetson from london activist anthony perrett from newport in wales communications officer alexandra

cambridgeshire in july last year she was the daughter of former f driver emilio de villota and competed in f gts touring cars and the superleague formula before joining up with the marussia team last year it was while testing for marussia that de villota lost her right eye despite spending a month in hospital de villota rebuilt her life and became part of the fia s women in motorsport commission it is thought she was promoting her autobiography at the time of her death with local media reports stating that she was found in a hotel room in seville after suffering a suspected heart attack de villota posted this picture on her twitter account yesterday with the caption de villota posted this picture on her twitter account yesterday with the caption with my friend manuel and i speak of him in yodona nice to see him again and talk a statement on de villota s facebook page signed by her family read dear friends maria has left us she had to go to heaven like all angels we are thankful to god for the extra year and a half that he left her with us a spokesperson said we have only just heard the news and we are awaiting to find out more we will comment at an appropriate time if the reports are true then it is obviously very tragic members of the motorsport community took to twitter to pay tribute to the young driver a message from sauber f team read we are shocked to hear about the death of maria de villota our sincerest condolences and sympathy to her family for this tragic loss caterham f team added we d like to echo the thoughts of the whole paddock and express our deepest condolences on the news of maria de villota s passing rip former f driver karun chandhok wrote tragic news about maria de villota sat next to her just a couple weeks ago at fia drivers comm meeting was doing a lot for women in racing sahara force india added very sad news coming from spain about brave maria de villota passing away our thoughts are with maria s family and friends in this moment sauber team principal monisha kaltenborn who worked alongside de villota as an ambassador for the women in motorsport commission paid her own tribute it didn t take her any time at all until she was back from her accident and was planning to maybe even drive kaltenborn told five live but more important for her was to really go out there and give other people the courage that you can still do so much even if you have such a major setback she s been one of the pillars of the work the fia ambassador programme has been doing because when you go out there you need to have credibility a strong personality and you need to be able to reach out to people and that s all she could do she had such a tragic experience and yet she had all that courage to be out there and talk about it and still to believe in that cause and she always had that smile on her face there are times when capital letters and a sad face fail to convey the true strength of your feelings in a text message or

clowns might ride a jovial hammer that can bonk the head of a mascot or political caricature at the bottom of the window is on offer the figure of hungarian physicist leo szilard loomed large in our house when i was a child he was held up to me as an exemplary figure in science a man who had made fundamental breakthroughs in nuclear physics but whose acute sense of moral probity led him in the end to denounce the very advances he had helped make only later did i learn an alternative version of his story almost exactly years ago in early october szilard was in london in transit from nazi germany when an idea came to him that would lead directly to the ultimate weapon of war the atomic bomb an article in the times two weeks earlier had reported a lecture at the british association by lord rutherford the nobel prize winning new zealand physicist and head of the cavendish laboratory in cambridge rutherford had described splitting the atom by bombarding it with protons but had gone on to say that any suggestion that the energy released might be harnessed as a source of power was talking moonshine the report caught szilard s attention he pondered it obsessively surely rutherford was wrong then early on a dismal grey morning as he waited on foot at a traffic light to cross busy southampton row near his hotel the answer came to him in a flash if a neutron fired at an atom produces the release of say two neutrons each of which hits another atom which both in turn release two more neutrons which each go on to collide with two further atoms a nuclear chain reaction would take place releasing unimaginable amounts of energy szilard tells this story twice with slightly differing details but the tale itself is consistent and delightfully vivid the challenge of rutherford s remark the heavy cold that had prevented szilard s attending the lecture the days spent thinking about it and the flash of inspiration just as the traffic light changed szilard immediately recognised the importance of his idea to ensure its security he patented it in the name of the british admiralty the patent included a clear description of neutron induced chain reactions to create explosions in august by which time szilard had moved on to the us he wrote to president franklin roosevelt to inform him that a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium was undoubtedly possible and could lead to the construction of extremely powerful bombs of a new type germany he warned might even now be developing such a weapon a single bomb of this type he wrote carried by boat and exploded in a port might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory the letter was signed by szilard and albert einstein by the time it reached roosevelt germany had invaded poland with war now a certainty the urgency was not lost on the us president a committee was set up to pursue the nuclear initiative out of which emerged what came to be known as the manhattan project the hugely ambitious and massively funded programme to develop a functioning atomic bomb in the shortest possible time continue reading the main story the dropping of the atomic bomb hiroshima shortly after the atomic bomb was dropped august two japanese cities hiroshima and nagasaki were bombed on respectively and august casualties have been estimated between and in hiroshima and at least in nagasaki roughly half of victims died within hours of the blast on august japan surrendered bringing wwii to an end bbc history the end of the war against japan a history of the world in objects hiroshima jam jar but less than six years later in szilard campaigned with equal passion to persuade the american government not to use the atomic bomb against a civilian population he understood better than anyone the enormity of the devastation such a weapon could cause but his petition although signed by a large number of nuclear physicists never reached the president so devastated was szilard at his failure to avert the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki the story i was brought up on concluded that he refused to do any further work in nuclear physics instead he moved research areas entirely to molecular biology a field concerned with the origins of life rather than its destruction to my father this audacious step captured the essence of scientific moral responsibility and i carried szilard s story with me as i grew up today however i know that inspiring as it is there are problems with this tale as often happens with history we have to treat with caution a narrative that fits so neatly the interests and preoccupations of the age in which it is written at the time i was being told this story britain was in the depths of the cold war in the post war years it turned out that szilard and indeed my own father found it impossible to obtain work on any scientific project that involved nuclear physics though they were barely aware of the stigma themselves the communist sympathies of their youth barred them from getting the necessary security clearance so szilard did not leave physics of his own accord at the end of the war he was abruptly dismissed from the manhattan project by its military head gen leslie groves groves had always suspected him of having russian sympathies and now deemed him too high a security risk forced to change field szilard was indeed prescient in choosing molecular biology which less than a decade later would uncover the secret of life in the form of the structure of dna my father s exemplary tale unravels further when we consider the way it presents the progress towards a functioning atomic bomb it narrates a smooth development from rutherford s lecture in london through szilard s and his fellow emigres journey from nazi germany via london to the us and szilard s single minded preoccupation with the potential threat of nuclear weapons to the manhattan project and finally to its very american triumphant or tragic outcome there is one final twist to what started out as a simple story some of you will have noticed that i gave the date of szilard s eureka moment at that traffic light on southampton row as october you may have had a date in september in your mind the truth is szilard tells the story twice as i mentioned in one version he records reading the times report and immediately having the idea of a chain reaction on september in the other he recalls fretting over the problem for weeks in his hotel room and pacing the streets of london deep in thought until the idea eventually came to him in early october so although the beginning of the story comes from the mouth of the man himself we cannot be certain which version is correct as a historian i have chosen the second as the more plausible particularly in view of that heavy cold which szilard tells us prevented his attending rutherford s lecture on september but that remains surmise historical narratives are never without their agendas my father s generation lived under the shadow of hiroshima and nagasaki he had been sent to do reconnaissance there only a few months after the bombs were dropped and had seen the consequences all too close up he told me a story which redeemed the scientist from the enormity of events brought about by fundamental research in physics it was a story that held the scientist responsible for lethal applications of pure research and proposed szilard as an iconic figure for recognising and taking that responsibility upon himself my father s story of leo szilard may not have been the truth but it taught me as a child a lasting salutary lesson about science and human values the government had priced the shares at between p but demand is outstripping supply and they will be sold for between p bbc business editor robert peston says applications for the shares are a few times the value of those on offer labour says there is a danger the privatisation undervalues the business shadow business secretary chuka umunna expressed concern over the possible sale of royal mail sites after the privatisation royal mail has a huge property portfolio in prime development sites in london and across britain and there is nothing to stop the privatised company making a quick buck by flogging off these assets for development he said he also said that if sites are sold customers could face longer trips to collect their mail the government is selling up to of the business and will keep the rest under the terms of the share sale a stake in the business has been reserved for royal mail employees strike vote members of the communication workers union are currently voting on whether to strike over the government s privatisation plan the ballot closes on october the earliest a strike could be held would be october members of the public can apply for royal mail shares online until october shares will begin trading in full on october the minimum application for the public wishing to purchase shares is or for eligible royal mail employees the government said it might also sell an additional of its stake in what is called an over allotment option if the demand for shares was very high in the official prospectus for the share issuing the royal mail warned that industrial action posed a potential risk for the share price the statement said national industrial action or the threat of national industrial action could also have a material adverse effect on the success of the offer and if it occurs after admission could cause the price of ordinary shares to fall significantly
